# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Project Detials
To become familar with Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**. To give some comfertablity with a large industry and that will help as a full stack developer. 

# Why
This builds upon the last 5 weeks of the course utiizing express, mysql, insomnia, and ORM. It is putting all together to make some models and routes that 
allow the databse to easily be interacted with and manipulated in a clear concise way. 

# Problems Solved
Created a databse and seeded it using mysql
make an app deployed at local host. 
server runs on insomnia 
API GET routes work in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags displayed in a formatted JSON
API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core work
completed the back end


# Problems
This took time reviewing alot of the weeks assignments and making sure I understood the concepts from the past few weeks, but the miniproject and activities (23,7,5) demonstrated most of the required functionality. 
Biggest hang up was figuring out why I couldn't seed the database which ened up being I forgot to update the .env file.
